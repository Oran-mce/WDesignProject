            <h2>Marvel Movie Franchise</h2>
            <p> The Marvel movie franchise is one of the biggest movie franchises in the world with everyone either having watched one of
                the movies or at least hearing of them. With these movies they also explore their own version of Norse Mythology which arent perfect
                adaptations of the gods or locations but they do give them different qualities. In the movies you cna see gods such as Thor, Odin, Loki
                and Heimdall. They also show Asgard and the events during Ragnarok which is a story from Norse Mythology which shows the destruction of Asgard.
                Although the depictions can be misleading from the stories told by the people of Scandanivia they are a good introduction to Norse Mythology.

                Mythology were heavily believed there is many references to it. Throughout the show you can see Odin as well as the warriors of Valhalla known as 
                Valkeries. You also discover that the main character is a descendant of Odin himself. </p>
